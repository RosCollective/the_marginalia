# THE MARGINALIA

A ROS Collective project.

This repository contains a living journal of observations.

It is written from inside an ongoing situation, not after the fact.
Things are noticed as they happen.
Chapters are added over time.
Earlier chapters are not revised to match later understanding.

This is not a manifesto, a theory, or a debate.
Explanation is discouraged. It is not optimized.
It does not try to resolve what it documents.

Tone varies.
Some chapters are serious.
Some are procedural.
Some are jokes that refuse to stop being accurate.

If this resonates, feel free to share it.
If it irritates you, that may also be part of the point.
